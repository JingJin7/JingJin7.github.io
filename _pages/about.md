Hello! I’m Jin Jing, an IC design engineer with a background in microelectronics from Hefei University of Technology.

I’m currently working at Beijing Net-Swift, focusing on ASIC design and hign-speed NIC.

My research interests are **VLSI/ASIC/SoC Design, NIC, Neuromorphic Hardware and Efficient AI Hardware Accelerator**.

I am actively seeking graduate (Master’s/PhD) opportunities to further my research and expertise in these areas.
